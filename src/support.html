    Hey! It happens to the best of us, but don't worry! We are here to help! Chill&chat is never perfect just like anything in this world. Please read the following carefully and we hope it will help you in some way!
    - Try checking system permissions and settings!
    Chill&chat needs certain privileges in order to run/function correctly! Give permission by going into Settings > Chill&chat and enable all permissions. Chill&chat also needs internet connection in order to use it's external services such as authentication! Check your internet connection and try again. You can find the connection settings by going into Settings > Connections > Wi-Fi and enable Wi-Fi.
    - Try restarting and resetting!
    Sometimes, you can fix your issue by clearing memory or restarting an app! Please slide up on the home screen and close the app, then, reload it from the home screen. You should also restart your device by holding the power buttons for 3 seconds and restarting it from there. If that did not work, try deleting the app and re-installing it from the app store. Please also remove any files linked to the app and try again.
    - Try updating!
    Chill&chat is a software that constantly evolves, so, sometimes an update may render another one useless. You should check your updates frequently by going into the app store. You should download it and try again after restarting your device.
    - Try contacting us!
    If none of the above worked, you should contact us by going into github and creating an issue. Please describe your issue in detail and we will try to fix it as soon as possible. You should always include, reproduction steps, device information and time of bug etc. Or contact us on eventide1029@gmail.com or cheng-alvin on github.
